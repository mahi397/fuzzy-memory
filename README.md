# Software Developer | Artist | NLP Enthusiast

## A little about me
I graduated from NSIT with a Bachelors in Information Technology, and have since been working in the software engineering domain. I work on Software Globalization at Adobe. Frontend development excites me, and my current area of research is Natural Language Processing in Indic languages. Outside of work hours, I like to read novels, watch movies, and look at flowers.


## Education
B.E., Information Technology | Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology, University of Delhi (_2020_)


## Technical Skills
I am passionate about building and designing products. Working on software localization, I play the language game for content so that customers get to communicate with products in their own languages.
I've worked with **TypeScript, React, and Python** across numerous software localization projects.
